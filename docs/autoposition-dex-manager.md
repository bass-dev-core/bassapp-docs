# 🗂️ AutoPosition DEX Manager

### 🚀 Key Features:

#### 🔄 **Auto-Repositioning of Liquidity (CLMM/DLMM Pools)**

* The bot automatically repositions liquidity when the market price moves outside the current range.
* Supports both passive (range-based) and active (price-following) strategies.
* Works with leading protocols like **Uniswap v3**, **Raydium CLMM**, and others.

#### ⚖️ **Impermanent Loss Prevention (IL Mitigation)**

* The bot constantly monitors price deviation and rebalances the position to reduce IL exposure.
* Offers optional hedging mechanisms using external assets or delta-neutral strategies.

#### 🎯 **Price Range Management Tools**

* Define a target price range for liquidity placement and let the bot manage liquidity concentration accordingly.
* Dynamic adjustment: The bot shifts your range based on market conditions, volatility, or trading volume.

#### 🧠 **Strategy Customization**

* Choose between pre-defined strategies: grid-based, volatility-driven, or yield-optimized.
* Advanced users can configure custom logic using simple rule builders (e.g., “if price > X, shift range”).

#### 💡 **Gas Optimization & Fee Recycling**

* Intelligent batching of transactions to minimize gas usage.
* Automatically reinvests earned trading fees into new liquidity positions.

#### 📊 **Analytics & Notifications**

* Real-time dashboards showing performance, fees earned, and IL estimates.
* Telegram/Discord/Email notifications on key events (e.g., price breakout, rebalance executed, APY drops).
