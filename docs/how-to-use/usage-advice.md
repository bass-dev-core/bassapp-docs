# ⚠️ Usage Advice

**Recommendations and warnings**

▶ **Availability of liquidity in any currency or USDT if the pool is in USDT;**

▶ **It is better to distribute liquidity to more wallets, then market-making will not be so noticeable;**

▶ **Recommended deposit on one wallet is 50$–100$+;**

▶ **If your strategy requires a large number of transactions, consider the cost per transaction:**

* The commission on Pump.fun is 1%;
* The Raydium pool takes a 0.25% commission;
* 0.3% goes to Raydium;
* 0.22% goes to the pool – basically you’re pumping your token. If the pool is CLMM, you will be able to get your money back, provided that the liquidity is not pledged.
