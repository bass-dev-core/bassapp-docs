# üñ•Ô∏è Technology Stack

BASS App leverages advanced trading logic inspired by traditional market-making and execution strategies, adapted specifically for the decentralized exchange (DEX) environment.

Our core focuses include:

* A modified and modular architecture based on proven trading models (e.g. inventory-based market making, TWAP/DCA logic, buyback & unwind strategies).
* Real-time synchronization with on-chain data and liquidity events across multiple blockchain environments, including EVM-compatible networks and Solana, utilizing account-based state models.
* High-availability infrastructure for decentralized markets, with layered caching, delayed triggers, and scheduled dispatching of transaction bundles.
* A hybrid execution engine with permissioned access to interact with liquidity pools, aggregators, and order routing interfaces.
* Secure encryption and handling of sensitive key material. User keys are client-side encrypted and stored in isolated environments with strict access control.
* All system components operate in logically separated environments with observability, signature validation, and end-to-end consistency guarantees.

This technical setup allows for seamless strategy execution while preserving strong guarantees around the confidentiality of user data and full control over token contract lifecycles.
